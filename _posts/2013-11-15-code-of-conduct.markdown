MadPUG is a community users' group intended for networking, collaboration, and 
learning in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Madison community and want 
all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all 
attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees 
throughout the conference and at all events, whether officially sponsored by 
MadPUG or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, 
organizers and volunteers at any event are required to conform to the 
following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout each 
event.

The Short Version
-----------------

MadPUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in 
any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including 
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not 
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave 
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary 
jokes are not appropriate for MadPUG.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole 
discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual 
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, 
sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other 
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and 
other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive 
swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for MadPUG.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the 
conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including 
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Contact Information
-------------------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have 
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff. You may also 
contact event volunteers and ask to be put in touch with the event organizer 
&mdash; Ian Cordasco.

MadPUG volunteers will be happy to help participants contact local law 
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing 
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meeting. We value your 
attendance.
