Unsurprisingly, MadPUG has filled [Bendyworks][] to capacity more than a
couple times during meet-ups. Since we naturally want to keep growing and do
not want to exclude anyone, I have sought out a new venue for MadPUG &mdash; 
the [Madison Public Library][mpl] (Central Location on West Mifflin).

Starting in January, MadPUG will be meeting on the second Tuesday of each 
month at the Library on the third floor. We have that space reserved for every 
month except March. The space will be able to accomodate at least double what 
Bendyworks can and we will be able to organize tables and presentations with 
greater ease.

As for this Thursday's meeting, we will hold it at Bendyworks and then we will 
take a short hiatus until January (December 19<sup>th</sup> is probably a bit 
too late in the month to hold a meeting anyway).
