We had a great turnout for Feburary's MadPUG meetup, [An Introduction to SciPy and Pandas][MUSP], thank you all for coming! As promised, here are the resources and source files from the talk.

Unfortunately, only the last few minutes of the screencast I recorded were
saved, so we'll have to make do with the notebook resources. I've included the HTML export for easy
viewing, plus the downloadable `.ipynb` notebook file and CSV data file for the climate change notebook.

* [IPython And Pylab Notebook][IPX] ([ipynb][IPNB])
* [Climate Change Notebook][CCX] ([ipynb][CCNB]) [datafile][CCD]

[James][J] also provided some great resources:

* [Python for Data Analysis][PYDA]
* [Coding the Matrix][PYMX]
* [SciKit and Numpy][PYMX]


To get started with SciPy, [pick a distribution from the SciPy site][SPI] and [get started][SPGS]!
