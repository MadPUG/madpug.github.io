Most local meet-ups never expect the need to have a Code of Conduct for their 
attendees and most do not. In fact, MadPUG has never had an incident occur 
that would indicate this is necessary which would make most beg the question 
"Why?".

The short answer is that a friend of mine was harrassed at a local meet-up 
approximately a month ago. Between that and the excellence of the PyCon Code 
of Conduct, the decision was simple.

I personally believe everyone should feel comfortable when attending a MadPUG 
meet-up and should feel comfortable knowing there is a system in place in the 
event that something does happen at a meet-up. As such, I have forked the 
PyCon Code of Conduct and edited it appropriately. A link to the code of 
conduct will always be in the header of this site and linked to in the MeetUp 
group.

If you want to contribute to the Code of Conduct to add something specific to 
MadPUG, you can do so [here][madpug-coc]. If instead, you would like to make a 
change to the original, you can contribute [here][pycon-coc]. I will 
occasionally pull in new changes to the PyCon Code of Conduct, so making 
changes there will trickle down into MadPUG's.
