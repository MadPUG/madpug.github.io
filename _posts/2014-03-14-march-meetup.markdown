This month I gave a presentation to introduce MadPUG's members to Testing. The 
topics we covered were:

- Testing Philosophy

  * What is a unit of code?

  * What is a unit test?

  * What is an integration test?

  * What is test independence and why is it important?

  * What is code coverage? Why is it important? What is it good for?

  * Test Driven Development

- Unittest - The Python Standard Library

  * Examples of tests written with unittest.

  * Examples of how to extend unittest.

- Py.test and why it is great.

  * Using py.test's fixtures.

- Mock

  * What is a mock?

  * Mocking out objects.

  * Patching objects and instances of objects.

  * When using the mock library is not appropriate.
